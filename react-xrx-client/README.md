# React xRx Client

## Introduction

The React xRx Client is a library designed to integrate the xRx system with React applications. It provides components and hooks that simplify the process of building reactive and reasoning-enabled user interfaces.

## Features

- React components for xRx integration
- Custom hooks for managing xRx state and actions
- Utilities for handling xRx events and responses
- Easy-to-use abstractions for xRx-powered UI elements

## Installation

The React xRx Client is part of the xRx-core submodule. Installation is automatic when you install the xRx-core submodule.

## Usage

```jsx
import { useXRx, XRxProvider } from 'react-xrx-client';

function App() {
  return (
    <XRxProvider>
      <YourComponents />
    </XRxProvider>
  );
}

function YourComponent() {
  const { state, dispatch } = useXRx();
  // Use xRx state and actions in your component
}
```
