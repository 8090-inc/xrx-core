# Introduction

Welcome to the xRx documentation! This documentation is designed to help you understand and use the xRx system.

## What is xRx?

**Any modality input (x), reasoning (R), any modality output (x).**

xRx is a framework for building AI-powered applications that interact with users across multiple modalities, where "x" represents the flexible integration of text, voice, and other interaction forms.

## Project Motivation

We believe the way we interact with software is changing and we're excited to be on the forefront of this movement. The xRx repository accelerates the development of multimodal AI applications, going beyond the typical focus on audio experiences. It serves as a foundation for AI-powered reasoning systems capable of engaging users through various modalities, including audio, text, app widgets, and more. This versatility sets xRx apart from most current multimodal AI systems, positioning it as a comprehensive solution for the evolving landscape of software interaction.
