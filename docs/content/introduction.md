# Introduction

Welcome to the xRx documentation! This documentation is designed to help you understand and use the xRx system.

## What is xRx?

xRx is a framework for building AI-powered reasoning systems that interact with users across multiple modalities, where "x" represents the flexible integration of text, voice, and other interaction forms.

xRx stands for "any modality input (x), reasoning (R), any modality output (x)."

## Project Motivation

We believe the way we interact with software is changing and we're excited to be on the forefront of this movement. The xRx repository serves as an accelerator for building systems for building voice based AI assistants. Unlike other audio based AI systems, xRx is not only to deliver a seamless audio experience. It is designed to be a building block for AI powered reasoning systems which can interact with users in a variety of modalities (audio, text, app widgets, and more).

## Navigating the Documentation

Our documentation is structured to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of xRx and guide you through its implementation. Here's an overview of what you'll find:
